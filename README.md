# ~~Introspection~~ Users + Funding Pools

## TODO:

- Cache server for query aggregates to improve on-chain query response.
    - (assuming we cover cost of some actions) command event -> on-chain write -> validate success -> cache invalidation event -> cache de-normalized query
    - This actually needs to be two services: cache + contract events
      - contract event log should be polled to trigger events across the bus, allowing easy checks for cache staleness. This should live beside the cache to reduce network latency.
        - We need to decide what should be banned vs purged
- Implement on-chain repos instead of Postgres mock
- Should users be charged for creating profile/pool contracts, or should the platform eat the cost?
- When beneficiary attempts a death claim on account, Twilio and email notifications should be sent to primary if contact details were provided.
- Should beneficiaries have an entity, or just be a function param?
- Query chain to verify account/beneficiary/contract actually exists. Validation currently only checks address can exist.
- Voting politics within an initiative pool
- Commenting

## Entities:

- account - a user's entire account (use viewable only)
- profile - a user's publicly viewable information
- initiative - an initiative pool owned by one or more accounts
